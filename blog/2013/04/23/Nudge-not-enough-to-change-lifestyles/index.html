<div class="entry-content"><p>By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News</p>

<p>The government is pilot the nudge theory in a number of areas including smoking cessation</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Plans to get people to adopt healthier lifestyles will not work unless the government is more prepared to use legislation, peers believe.</p>

<p>The House of Lords science and technology committee said ministers seemed to be mistaken in their use of what is known as the nudge theory.</p>

<p>Nudging people is about getting them to change their behaviour without necessarily banning activities.</p>

<p>But the group said that did not mean legislation should not be used at all.</p>

<p>Both the prime minister and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley are known to be admirers of the nudge theory.</p>

<p> <em>It formed a key part of the government&rsquo;s public health strategy which was set out at the end of last year.</em></p>

<p>A unit has also been established in the Cabinet Officeto push ahead with policies. Pilots to get people to quit smoking and increase organ donor registration have already been arranged.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Important lever&#8217;But the cross-party group of peers suggested there was confusion within government over what nudging actually involved, as they had been given different definitions by officials.</p>

<p>The peers also said the government&rsquo;s pursuit ofnon-regulatory steps had created an environment whereby nudge was being seen as something that did not require legislation.</p>

<p><strong>What is nudge?</strong></p>

<p>It is an idea based on a book by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein which advocates influencing behaviour by altering the context or environment in which people choose.</p>

<p>It differs from traditional approaches to changing lifestyles which tend to be moreovert.</p>

<p> <em>Conventional measures might include steps such as bans, using tax to increase price or promotional campaigns.</em></p>

<p>But nudge tends to be moresubtle, perhaps involving providing information about social norms.</p>

<p>It can also include changing the environment, such asinstalling fewer lifts in a building to encourage people to use the stairs more.</p>

<p>Another approach is altering the &lsquo;default setting&rsquo; so that people get salad with their meal rather than say chips unless they specifically ask for them.</p>

<p><strong>Why a nudge is not enough</strong></p>

<p> <em>But they said this was not always the case</em> , recommending the government took steps to ensure traffic light labelling appears on food.</p>

<p>This contrasts with thegovernment&rsquo;s tactics to date which have been more focused on using voluntary agreements.</p>

<p>For example, earlier this year ministers launched the &ldquo;responsibility deal&rdquo; which saw more than 170 companies put their names to a series of pledges covering physical activity, alcohol, health at work and food.</p>

<p>The committee is also calling for an independent chief social scientist to be appointed to provide government with &ldquo;robust&rdquo; advice.</p>

<p>Committee chairman Baroness Neuberger said:&ldquo;There are all manner of things that the government want us to do &#8211; lose weight, give up smoking, use the car less, give blood &#8211; but how can they get us to do them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy and this inquiry has shown that it certainly won&rsquo;t be achieved through using nudges, or any other sort ofintervention, in isolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Lindsey Davies, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said it was a &ldquo;welcome and timely report&rdquo;.</p>

<p> <em>&ldquo;The public health profession has long argued that &lsquo;nudging&rsquo; is but one aspect of a wide programme of interventions to help people make changes in their lives which promote good health and wellbeing.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>A Cabinet Office spokesman said the recommendations would be considered.</p>

<p>But he added: &ldquo;We are glad that they recognise that that the application ofbehavioural insights continues to be an important policy lever for government. These often complement other, more traditional policy tools.&rdquo;</p>
