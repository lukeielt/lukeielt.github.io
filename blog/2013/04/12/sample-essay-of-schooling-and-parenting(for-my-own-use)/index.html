<p>Children are the future. Therefore, early childhood education is the utmost priority on the importance list concerned by parents, schools and states. When it comes to who should be responsible for educating children into useful adults, there is an ongoing debate. Many advocate that comparing with school education, parenting is of more significance in this aspect.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Such beliefs are not groundless. Above all, parents are the first teacher to children. Their ways of thinking and behaviour decide what their children will be like in the future. As is reported, a child&rsquo;s basic skill of communication and language is formed in the first three years in his/ her life, and this indicates that any verbal and physical movement parents made in these three years will help to build a child&rsquo;s personality and a basic concept about people and the outside world. Moreover, the mindset of being grateful and respectful to good deeds and people are taught by parents. When parents take care of their older parents at home, their ways of helping the elderly have a great reflection on children&#8217; mind, which do lead a young to a lifelong way of showing respect to the old and the needed. Also, the ability of love and being loved is imparted by parents in a tender manner. A kid learn this ability by feeling the most earnest love to himself or herself from parents, and they start getting the importance of love and being loved. A person who can behave appropriately, respect and love others is believed to be a valuable member of society.</p>

<p>However, some still argue that rather than parenting, schooling in fact plays a more influential role in children&#8217; development. In their opinion, a child is supposed to obtain theoretical knowledge of a range of subjects and the ability to win the fierce competition among peers by attending normal schooling.Success it might lead children to, there is hardly any evidence linking schooling to the future of being a good community member in a child. No matter how successful a person could be, financially or academically, there is still a high possibility that a well-school-educated person finally turn out to be a selfish adult who has no basic passion towards human being and community. There are too many examples to illustrate  a higher education qualification dose not guarantee a well manner or behavior in that person. In comparison to parenting, which is widely thought as a necessary and sufficient condition in the process of educating children into valuable adults, schooling is believed only a necessary condition at its best.</p>
