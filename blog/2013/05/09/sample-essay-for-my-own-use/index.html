<div class="entry-content"><p> <em>A long-distance flight consumes the fuel as much as a car consumes in several years time, and causes the same amount of pollution as cars. So some people think we should abandon the non-essential fights (such as for tourism), and it is more efficient than restricting the car use. Give your opinion about it.</em></p>

<p>Tourism has fueled up air travel industry and its thriving creates millions of jobs and billions of revenue each year. Therefore, sorting tourism flights as non-essential is unreasonable and to ban these flights, although it would defuse the conflict between energy crisis and commercial profits temporarily, is to backfire both airtravel and tourism industry.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It is, indeed, reported that a long-distance flight consumes the amount of fuel that a car consumes in seven years. But it is also reported that major aerodynamic companies are investing both huge money and labor in the invention and improvement of energy-efficient engine and light materials to cut off fuel consumption and pollution. They are motivated to do so because fuel consumption accounts for up to 70% in their total running cost and the results are promising, light materials, more dual batteries and new engine have been invented and put into use, and they made a less 20%-40% fuel consumption possible.</p>

<p>In terms of air pollution, banning flights is not an effective way either. Traveling by flight has become an essential part for most modern people, including not only foreign trade businessmen, international journalists but also ordinary people who would travel or study abroad. the manmade prohibition will inconvenience these activities drastically and thus trigger public anger or even protests. It is democratic society, any decision made against the public’s interests would definitely araise mass dissensus, which would be a huge hurdle to the implementation.</p>

<p>Prohibiting is not the answer to everything that causes problems temporarily. To make a sensible policy is firstly to investigate the causes of the problems and then come up solutions accordingly. Any surfaced or immediate policy could, at best, scratch the surface of the problem and more often, creates more troubles than it solves. The banning of flight according to the so-called necessity would cause the latter, because it jump to the conclusion based on a single fact-huge consumption and pollution, but neglect the necessity of flights to the public and the inconvenience and anger that would come after such rude and much-too-simple solution. While others alternatives bring in good news, people, especially those policy makers, should at least give them a try. The banning, if needed, should be the last step to take, because it is just a passive way to solve any problem.</p>
