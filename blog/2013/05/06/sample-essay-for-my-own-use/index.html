<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Some people think that traditional culture is being damaged as it is used as a tool to make money in the tourism industry. Others think it is the only way to preserve and protect culture and tradition. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></p>

<p>Official reports give information on the huge amount of revenue that tourism generated every year. However, the worry about the damage brought by this prospering industry is also mounting, the damage to local culture and tradition in particular. Whether tourism is the culprit behind the culture damage or the only protector for local culture and tradition has remained unsettled and it is time we have a close look on both arguments.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Tourism is a way but not the only way to protect culture and tradition. Today,  tourism industry ranks the fourth in the GDP contributing sector globally and it has created millions of jobs and more importantly brought in billions of revenue each year. This amount of money, as believed, can be used in the protection and maintainance of local historic relics and traditional culture because these cultural heritage is the biggest selling point in local tourism development. So it is the virtuous circle which generated money from and for local culture and tradition and a good way to protect and preserve indigenous culture.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it has been pointed out that tourism industry thrives at the price of local culture and environment. Being made as tourists attractions, local culture and tradition are becoming increasingly ‘artificial’ due to the overwhelming man inference in the process of creating a ‘tourist hot spot’ to attract visitors and money. A number of examples show that in order to attract tourists, many’hilarious and appealing to tourists’ traditional cultures have been rehearsed and put on shows in tourist destinations while other more reserved and difficult-in -understanding traditions are filtered and ignored. This manmade arrangement can be extremely hazardous to the protection of local tradition and culture because it changes the nature of them and more worse, it could make the local people regard the treat their convention and culture in a ‘money-oriented’ way.</p>

<p>Tourism, therefore, is a industry that brings in both good and harm. It is clear that this industry is not the only way to protect and preserve local culture and tradition despite the huge amount of revenue. It is a way to generate money to protect local cultural heritage and this is a worth-mentioned contribution. However, what it does to influence the way local people treat their culture should be supervised carefully, because if not, local culture and tradition would become a tool to earn money for the people instead of being an indispensable part in their lives as they used to be. So the two arguments are both melodramatic and a moderate and carefully-planned  development in tourism industry is now what people call for.</p>
