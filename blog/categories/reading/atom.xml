    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the continued demand for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly solutions, sustainability has become an important trend when choosing products for retail, healthcare, and other commercial applications.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>With the development of LED technology, advertising display productsare better able to meet these demands more than ever. When compared with other traditional light sources such as fluorescent and incandescent, LED consumes about 40% less power, making it extremely energy efficient.</p>

<p>In addition, it lasts anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 hours – eliminating the need to replace lamps that can be harmful to the environment because of their mercury content. And, LED’s contain no mercury, making them an environmentally friendly choice.</p>

<p>All of these characteristics make LED technology a popular solution for sustainable projects. The really great thing about LED’s is that there is no sacrificing light quality for sustainability. This technology creates bright, white, uniform illumination making it the ideal choice to promote your product or service through eye-catching graphics. You can choose from a variety of sizes, shapes and profiles based on your specific needs.</p>

<p>Next time, use an LED light box to promote your business, and you’ll help improve your bottom line while also helping the planet!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Collusion between political elites, civil servants and logging companies issystematically robbing people of their livelihoods, says a report (pdf) into corrupt forestry practices in Africa.</p>

<p>The extensive granting of &ldquo;shadow permits&rdquo; for small-scale logging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Liberia, Ghana and Cameroon bypasses new laws and environmental safeguards, and is forcing communities to meet their timber needs illegally, says NGO Global Witness.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The report, Logging in the shadows, identifies a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; pattern of abuse in which hundreds of permits intended to promote small businesses and meet local needs are being allocated to large, often foreign, logging companies. These &ldquo;shadow permits&rdquo; open the door tolucrative, large-scale logging operations, which bypass the oversight of the authorities, it says.</p>

<p>In the DRC, dozens of artisanal logging permits were issued between 2010 and 2012, mostly to foreign industrial companies,violating DRC&rsquo;s forest laws in at least 10 different ways. In Liberia, companies have abused licences known as &ldquo;private use permits&rdquo; to buy a quarter of the country&rsquo;s totallandmass in only two years. In Ghana, the forestry commissionis said to have granted more than 400 logging permits secretly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a veryworrying trend. Logging companies are systematically <strong>colluding with</strong> corrupt officialsto get around laws designed to stop themdecimating forests and abusing those who live in them. This is massivelyundermining international efforts to regulate thetimber trade,&rdquo; said Alexandra Pardal, Europe campaigner at Global Witness.</p>

<p>The report said: &ldquo;European-led reform efforts have focused on large-scale concessions that produce timber for export, but in each country shadow permits have provided aloophole to bypass tighter regulations. Weaknesses in legal frameworks and corruption at all levels of government have enabled companies to continue to export large amounts of timber to the EU, US and China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Global Witness, €12.4bn (£10.5bn) worth of timber considered to pose a &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; of illegality entered the EU in 2011. On 3 March, a new EU law prohibited the import of illegal timber (pdf), but Global Witness and Greenpeace have uncovered suspicious log shipments at EU ports in the past two months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless European and Africanpolicymakers <strong>take urgent action</strong> , shadow permits could become theTrojan horse by which illegal timber is brought into the EU and passed off as legitimate,&rdquo; said Pardal. &ldquo;Timber importers must do proper checks right the way along their supply chains to make sure they know exactly where their timber came from and whether the permit used to get it was legal.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By Harold E. Varmus, Director of the U.S. National Cancer Institute; and Robert D. Hormats, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment</p>

<p>For many people, the term biodiversity might seem highly technical and irrelevant to their day to day concerns. If you think that, think again. It may just save your life.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Biological diversity—or biodiversity—simplyrefers to the variety of plants, animals, and other living things on Earth.  <strong>The Earth’s biodiversity has an immense impact on our daily lives and cannot be taken for granted.</strong>  Today, Earth Day, is a chance to reflect on the value of our planet’s biodiversity and to take action to ensure that it is protected.</p>

<p>Tragically—and to the detriment of all of us— <strong>Earth’s biodiversity is disappearing at an alarming rate.</strong>  <strong>This is due to factors such as  </strong>deforestation, environmental degradation, and habitat destruction from agriculture, settlement, and other uses; pollution; climate change; and chronic over-exploitation or poaching of fish and wildlife species.<strong> </strong> Scientists estimate that the planet is losing species at a rate 1,000 to 10,000 times above the rate of species extinction that would occur normally without human activity. <strong>Particularly disheartening is the fact that</strong>, in many cases, we are losing species before we even know of them or know how they fit into our shared planet.</p>

<p><strong>The benefits of biodiversity are immeasurable</strong>. Biodiversity is the foundation of agriculture, forests, and fisheries.Plants and animals support tourism and trade. Biodiversity in ecosystems plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle and contributes to nutrient and water cycling. The loss of life on Earth—from microscopic bacteria to migratory birds—threatens the proper function of our planet. Moreover, biodiversity loss deprives humanity of scientific insights into the origins and evolution of life,as well as future beneficial discoveries in medicine, agriculture, and other fields.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples of advances stemming from bio-inspiration: The piranha bite-proof scales of the arapaima fish are being studied by scientists and engineers to develop new types of body armor that are strong yet flexible. Lessons learned from biological antifreeze proteins found in the blood of Arctic fish are being used to enhance cyro-preservation techniques for human organ transplants, improve the nutrition and taste of frozen foods, and increase the temperature tolerance of agricultural crops.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing inspiration from nature is not new.</strong> The Wright Brothers’ glider and airplane designs were based, in part, upon their observations of pigeons in flight. Wilbur Wright noticed that pigeons bent the tips of their wings to maintain proper balance and equilibrium in flight. This led to the breakthrough concept of wing-warping, which the Wright Brothers successfully used to control turning in their flier.</p>

<p><strong>Protecting our planet’s biodiversity is especially important to every one of us because it can help make the difference between life and death for ourselves and countless future generations.</strong> Medical history is ripe with examples of chemicals and pharmaceutical products derived from naturally occurring plants or bacteria that prevent or treat serious diseases. Among these are digitalis (found in foxglove and used to treat heart failure for at least three centuries); the many antibiotics found in soil bacteria; artemisinins (first used in China in the third century as an extract of sweet wormwood and now part of the standard treatment for malaria world-wide); taxol (from yew trees) and colchicine (from autumn crocus) used for treatment of many cancers and gout; and even aspirin (from willow bark) used to treat a wide variety of inflammatory disorders, allay pain, and prevent inappropriate clotting and certain cancers.</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity loss runs the real risk of depriving us of the plants, animals, and microorganisms that could unlock cures for some of mankind’s most devastating ailments.</strong> Therefore—whether we suffer from a headache or heart disease—we all benefit from biodiversity and we all have a strong interest in fighting against the many policies and practices that threaten the variety of life on Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Once a species is gone, it is gone forever. Maintaining the Earth’s biodiversity—the broad and rich variety of life on our planet that is the product of billions of years of evolution—by preserving our forests, jungles, deserts, oceans, estuaries, and other habitats is critical to supporting the development of life-saving medicines and other bio-inspired innovations, as well as to ensuring the continued viability of our planet. Alternatively,</strong> the continued loss of biodiversity will seriously and adversely affect—in countless ways—all species, including Homo sapiens. If that fact fails to encourage all of us to make greater efforts to protect biodiversity, it is hard to know what will.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, a four-year-old was treated for screen addiction. Emma Cook investigates the dangerous seduction of smartphones and tablets</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Saturday morning and my children bunch together on the sofa, limbs entwined but minds very much elsewhere, hurled into their several worlds thanks to a couple of iPads and an iPod touch. Everywhere I look there isevidence of heavy usage and dependency. Discarded screen wipes, ear-phone wires and socket extensions trail across the floor.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>&ldquo;Now – now – I need my next charge,&rdquo; gasps my 10-year-old son, whenever his iPad threatens toflatline andslip below 10%.</p>

<p>My two-year-old, Amelia, deflates when Waybuloo fades to black, a signal for me to scrabble around in the detritus for a lead before there&rsquo;s an iTantrum. Amelia responds soinstinctively to a touch-screen, she strokes every flat surface expectantly, waiting for it to light up and activate.</p>

<p>We watch the Apple logo pulse seductively back to life a few minutes later. &ldquo;Look, iPad waking up again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re all plugged in, I slope back to the kitchen leaving behind a clashing chorus of soundtracks dredged from all corners of the internet; these days Dani&rsquo;s House and Minecraft fused with a little Harlem Shake. We retreat and tune out, my husband on his iPod while I scroll through my online newspaper.</p>

<p> <em>Welcome to my iFamily</em> , one  <strong>where our leisure time is increasingly shaped by tablets, phones and laptops</strong>  – either Apple or its proliferating rivals – and  <strong>where much of our weekend communication is characterised by the following</strong> : Louis, 10: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your password for iTunes again?&rdquo;; Evie, nine: &ldquo;Mum, Amelia just deleted the Lovefilm app&rdquo;; Amelia: &ldquo;iPad gone black.&rdquo; Cries. So it goes on.</p>

<p>Our family is not alone. Only this week, it emerged that a four-year-old girl is having compulsive behaviour therapy after becoming increasingly &ldquo;distressed and inconsolable&rdquo; when the iPad was taken away. Her use of the device had escalated over the course of a year and she was using it up to four hours a day.</p>

<p>Sometimes, like her parents I&rsquo;m sure, I can&rsquo;t help pining for the monolithic charms of the television – only one remote to control, one voice, programme or soundtrack. Now whenever I turn my back, another screen pops up, another window and volume button with a squawking, tinny soundtrack. It&rsquo;s as if Apple has been breeding in my living room; its slim screens and sleek lines clogging up our shelves and kitchen surfaces, beyond reproach because they look so good. TVs were certainly as addictive but they were never objects of desire in themselves – a double curse.</p>

<p>When our 10-year-old begged us for an iPad mini for Christmas, we caved in partly because we were seduced too. Parents are as childishly enthralled as their teenage sons and tiny babies, which is why they have infiltrated family life <strong>on such an unprecedented scale</strong>  – over 100m iPads had sold worldwide by last year.</p>

<p>The problem is, it&rsquo;s ashared family dependency and I can only really blame myself. I&rsquo;ve recently bought a new laptop and smartphone and am enthralled with – and hooked on – both. I&rsquo;m as addicted as they are, so do I have any right to complain? As a parent, I should monitor and impose many more rules than I do. Instead, Iresort to exasperated threats, shrieking at them when it gets to homework, bath and guitar practice times. With the communal joys of FaceTime, my lame rants and outbursts are often witnessed in real time with great amusement by a bunch of their friends, and parents too for all I know.</p>

<p>Partly I resist being too stringent because, clearly, I enjoy the window of freedom this shared technology affords. Having a toddler third time round isn&rsquo;t the same deal at all – long car journeys are less fraught. Reading a newspaper feature uninterrupted on a Saturday morning is no longer in the realm of fantasy. I&rsquo;m not complaining – I just don&rsquo;t feel this development has led to my finest parenting moments.</p>

<p>Last Friday, I vacuumed the house while Amelia looked at YouTube. As I sucked up the last bit of fluff from behind the sofa, I noticed she was watching Mickey Mouse in Russian. On the upside, her cultural references are diverse these days; she can sing in Korean, thanks to Gangnam Style.</p>

<p>I can also see how much pleasure she derives from the immediacy of the touch screen; her joy at controlling what she consumes with a fingertip, right there and then. While she happily navigates her way around the iPlayer and sends out the odd accidental tweet via her favourite Japanese game app, her grandma sits next to her on her own iPad watching repeats of Pointless.</p>

<p>I know that banning or denying them would be useless. Instead, I prefer to re-frame my limp submission as pragmatic and innovative. Indeed, according to Rose Luckin, professor of learner-centred design at the University of London, specialising in children and technology, I am embracing the future, engaging as a family rather than  <strong>taking an extreme position that would only drive their usage underground.</strong>  She says, &ldquo;In all the time I&rsquo;ve been studying technology and family, the most overwhelmingly successful approach is when you open it up with your children, find out how it works, understand what&rsquo;s good and bad and all engage with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In her research, Luckin has discovered that tablets can encourage the sort of social interaction that aids education and learning. &ldquo;One of the key benefits is that they can become a focus for discussion between parents and children. These devices are easy to share – they are not as isolating as PCs used to be. They are a window to a larger experience that can connect you to different parts of family life – pictures, videos, books, learning.&rdquo; We do seem to use these devices in proximity; my children tend not to take them to their bedrooms, they squeeze up on the sofa sharing games and apps.</p>

<p>I know that where it can all unravel is when you treat a tablet as a childminders. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re making good use of the iNanny,&rdquo; noted one mother drily when she came to visit. Luckin says, &ldquo;The device on its own won&rsquo;t offer much that is positive. It has to be part of a united family effort of working out how to embrace it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If not, theirimpact is inevitably divisive. I&rsquo;m extremely aware that family conflict in our household tends to erupt when I&rsquo;ve allowed the children to languish for too long on screens. I vent my guilt and frustration, usually with impotent threats to throw away their chargers, a negative cycle that plays out too often.</p>

<p>Luckin&rsquo;s right – where iPads work best is when we share activities; digesting and reading information for school projects, drawing and creating stuff together with art and animation apps, watching Miranda on the iPlayer.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m more aware of these dynamics, the culture of the iPad has forced us to modify our behaviour … slightly. We do manage to ringfence time, scheduling hours for reading books as well as upping the amount of activities outside the home, one sure way to avoid the temptation altogether.</p>

<p>Often one form of consumption can inform another; Louis admitted recently that he&rsquo;d been watching something very funny on the iPad about the Pink Pussy nightclub. Horrified, I demanded to know what it was and he navigated me swiftly to the new series of Blandings on iPlayer. He enjoys it so much that I now read him PG Wodehouse each evening.</p>

<p>Tablets are intrinsically democratic; they defy the traditional patriarchal model of parenting, which can&rsquo;t be a bad thing. As Luckin says, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be confronted with them at school and friends' houses, so parents need to ask, &lsquo;How do we turn it to our best advantage?&rsquo;&rdquo; In my household, letting Amelia surf YouTube while I pour another glass of wine is probably the truthful answer.</p>

<p><strong>Setting online boundaries for children</strong></p>

<p>• It&rsquo;s not about your child&rsquo;s behaviour but your own. Do you spend your life attached to your smartphone or tablet, never quite switching off, always poised to pounce when the new message alert sounds? If so, take heed: as with the rest of parenting, your child learns much more from what you do than from what you say. If you want to encourage a toddler to concentrate on one thing at a time, don&rsquo;t read bedtime stories with one eye on the Blackberry.</p>

<p>• It&rsquo;s never too early to set boundaries on, for example, the time a child may spend on a tablet. There is not enough research to know what the limits should be – so trust your instincts. Establish in your child&rsquo;s mind that there are rules and limits: these will be different at three than 13, but the first thing to emphasise is the framework.</p>

<p>• If you feel your child is obsessed with a piece of technology or software,reduce its availability. If you feel your child&rsquo;s behaviour is affected adversely, ban its use altogether. You&rsquo;re in charge.</p>

<p>•Abstinence is not the answer. By puberty your child will engage with technology, whatever you allowed when they were tiny. And without a build-up of sensible rules and attitude in early childhood, an older child will find it harder to negotiate the world of smartphones and iPads.</p>

<p>• Your attitude to your child&rsquo;s relationship to technology  <strong>should mirror</strong>  the relationship to food. Left to their own devices, many children would eat chocolate and ice-cream all day long, but no sensible parent would allow that. A child needs a balanced diet of fun and interaction offline, as well as online.</p>

<p>• Learning tosocialise and interact online starts with learning those skills offline, not the other way round.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News</p>

<p>The government is pilot the nudge theory in a number of areas including smoking cessation</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Plans to get people to adopt healthier lifestyles will not work unless the government is more prepared to use legislation, peers believe.</p>

<p>The House of Lords science and technology committee said ministers seemed to be mistaken in their use of what is known as the nudge theory.</p>

<p>Nudging people is about getting them to change their behaviour without necessarily banning activities.</p>

<p>But the group said that did not mean legislation should not be used at all.</p>

<p>Both the prime minister and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley are known to be admirers of the nudge theory.</p>

<p> <em>It formed a key part of the government&rsquo;s public health strategy which was set out at the end of last year.</em></p>

<p>A unit has also been established in the Cabinet Officeto push ahead with policies. Pilots to get people to quit smoking and increase organ donor registration have already been arranged.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Important lever'But the cross-party group of peers suggested there was confusion within government over what nudging actually involved, as they had been given different definitions by officials.</p>

<p>The peers also said the government&rsquo;s pursuit ofnon-regulatory steps had created an environment whereby nudge was being seen as something that did not require legislation.</p>

<p><strong>What is nudge?</strong></p>

<p>It is an idea based on a book by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein which advocates influencing behaviour by altering the context or environment in which people choose.</p>

<p>It differs from traditional approaches to changing lifestyles which tend to be moreovert.</p>

<p> <em>Conventional measures might include steps such as bans, using tax to increase price or promotional campaigns.</em></p>

<p>But nudge tends to be moresubtle, perhaps involving providing information about social norms.</p>

<p>It can also include changing the environment, such asinstalling fewer lifts in a building to encourage people to use the stairs more.</p>

<p>Another approach is altering the &lsquo;default setting&rsquo; so that people get salad with their meal rather than say chips unless they specifically ask for them.</p>

<p><strong>Why a nudge is not enough</strong></p>

<p> <em>But they said this was not always the case</em> , recommending the government took steps to ensure traffic light labelling appears on food.</p>

<p>This contrasts with thegovernment&rsquo;s tactics to date which have been more focused on using voluntary agreements.</p>

<p>For example, earlier this year ministers launched the &ldquo;responsibility deal&rdquo; which saw more than 170 companies put their names to a series of pledges covering physical activity, alcohol, health at work and food.</p>

<p>The committee is also calling for an independent chief social scientist to be appointed to provide government with &ldquo;robust&rdquo; advice.</p>

<p>Committee chairman Baroness Neuberger said:&ldquo;There are all manner of things that the government want us to do &#8211; lose weight, give up smoking, use the car less, give blood &#8211; but how can they get us to do them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy and this inquiry has shown that it certainly won&rsquo;t be achieved through using nudges, or any other sort ofintervention, in isolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Lindsey Davies, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said it was a &ldquo;welcome and timely report&rdquo;.</p>

<p> <em>&ldquo;The public health profession has long argued that &lsquo;nudging&rsquo; is but one aspect of a wide programme of interventions to help people make changes in their lives which promote good health and wellbeing.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>A Cabinet Office spokesman said the recommendations would be considered.</p>

<p>But he added: &ldquo;We are glad that they recognise that that the application ofbehavioural insights continues to be an important policy lever for government. These often complement other, more traditional policy tools.&rdquo;</p>
